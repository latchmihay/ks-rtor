# ks-rtor

Simple utility that looks for completed torrents in rutorrent and extracts them via tha rutorrent provided scripts. 
It also deletes the torrent and its data after it has been seeded for a week.

### Dependency
- rutorrent

#### Notes
- Its pretty shitty I know but as you can tell I didnt spend any time on it, and it does the job
